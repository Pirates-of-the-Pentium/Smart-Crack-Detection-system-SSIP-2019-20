 Video Analytics for Identifying Cracks, Anomalies through Video and Giving Detailed Feedback

Cracks or swelling on a machine part should be ideally detected at an early stage in order to prevent further damage. To ensure safety, it is necessary to inspect the quality of machine/machine parts at regular intervals. part. High quality images of machine parts are captured and subsequently analysed to build an automated crack classification system. After feature extraction using the training set images, statistical inference algorithms are employed in Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform to identify cracks. The detection and identification of defects at the early stage will helps smooth production process, saves production cost and time.
